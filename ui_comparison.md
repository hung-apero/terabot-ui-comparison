# TeraBot UI Comparison: Implementation vs Figma Design

## 1. SubscriptionActivity

| Component | Current Implementation | Figma Design (node-id=1966-5409) | Differences |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| Background | Uses `R.drawable.bg_chat_screen` as a background image with ContentScale.FillHeight | Gradient background with specific colors | Background implementation differs from design |
| Header Section | Title "Get PRO Access" with TeraBot PRO label | Similar title with TeraBot PRO badge | Mostly aligned but styling details may differ |
| Feature List | Implemented as FeatureList component with icon and text | Features with icons and text | Styling may differ in spacing and icon sizes |
| Countdown Timer | Implementation available with animation | Timer with hours/minutes/seconds | May have styling differences |
| Subscription Options | Two implementations: standard and sale options | Multiple subscription options with discounts | Implementation has both standard and sale options with different styling |
| Subscribe Button | Gradient background with rounded corners | Similar gradient button with arrow icon | Mostly aligned with minor styling differences |
| Footer Links | TOS and Privacy links at bottom | Similar links at the bottom | Appears to be aligned |
| Close Button | Small X button in a circular background | Similar close button | May have styling differences |

### Notable Issues:
- Background implementation might not match the exact gradient from Figma
- Spacing and padding values may not exactly match the Figma design
- Font styles and sizes might have slight differences
- Sale subscription styling may differ from Figma

## 2. MainActivity

| Component | Current Implementation | Figma Design (node-id=1966-3844) | Differences |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| Background | Conditional background with `bg_chat_screen` | Different backgrounds for different tabs | Implementation matches this conditional approach |
| Top Bar | MainTopBar with settings, app name, and PRO button | Similar top bar with settings and PRO button | Mostly aligned but styling may differ |
| Navigation Bar | Bottom navigation with 3 tabs | Similar bottom navigation with 3 tabs | Icons and styling may differ slightly |
| Main Content | HorizontalPager with 3 different screens | Different content for each tab | Content implementation matches the tab-based approach |
| Banner Ad | Banner ad at the bottom | No ad in design | Addition of banner ad in implementation |
| Settings Button | Icon button with settings icon | Similar settings icon | Likely aligned |
| PRO Button | Button with star icon and "PRO" label | Similar button design | Button styling may differ slightly |
| Report Button | Conditional display | May be present in design | Visibility logic may differ |

### Notable Issues:
- Banner ad implementation not present in Figma design
- Tab styling and icons may differ from Figma
- Spacing and alignment might not perfectly match
- Content implementations within tabs need individual comparison

## General Observations

1. **Color Scheme**:
   - Implementation uses AppColor values which may not exactly match Figma color codes
   - Gradient implementations may differ in color stops and angles

2. **Typography**:
   - Implementation uses SvnGilroy and InterFont families
   - Font weights and sizes may not perfectly match Figma specifications

3. **Component Structure**:
   - Implementation generally follows similar component hierarchy as Figma
   - Some components are combined or separated differently

4. **Responsiveness**:
   - Implementation includes responsive sizing which may not be fully represented in static Figma designs

5. **Animations**:
   - Implementation includes animations (like for the countdown timer) which are not visible in static Figma designs

## Recommendations

1. Review and align color values with exact Figma specifications
2. Verify font families, weights, and sizes match Figma design
3. Check spacing, padding, and margins against Figma measurements
4. Ensure icon designs match exactly, particularly for navigation bars
5. Address any conditional UI elements that may not match the design intent
6. Consult with design team about banner ad implementation
7. Consider pixel-perfect measurement tools to ensure exact alignment
