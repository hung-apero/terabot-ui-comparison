# TeraBot UI Comparison

This repository contains a comparison between the current implementation of TeraBot's UI and the Figma designs.

## Files in this Repository

1. **ui_comparison.md** - A markdown document with a detailed analysis of the differences between the current implementation and Figma designs for:
   - SubscriptionActivity (Figma node-id=1966-5409)
   - MainActivity (Figma node-id=1966-3844)

2. **TeraBot_UI_Comparison.csv** - A CSV file with a more detailed component-by-component analysis that can be opened in Excel or other spreadsheet software.

## How to Use These Comparisons

### For Developers
1. Use these comparisons to identify components that need alignment with the designs
2. Focus on high-priority items marked with "No" in the Matching column
3. Work through items with "Unknown" status by comparing with Figma

### For Designers
1. Review the implementation details to understand how the designs were translated to code
2. Identify areas where design specifications need to be more explicit
3. Discuss implementation decisions with developers

## Areas of Focus

Based on the comparison, these areas need the most attention:

1. Background implementations - particularly gradients and images
2. Font styles, sizes, and weights across components
3. Spacing, padding, and margin values
4. Color values and gradient definitions
5. Component hierarchies and structure
6. Addition of components not in the original design (e.g., banner ads)

## Next Steps

1. Use tools like Figma's Inspect mode to get exact values for spacing, colors, etc.
2. Create a priority list of UI adjustments based on this comparison
3. Implement changes systematically to align the app with Figma designs
4. Re-evaluate after changes to ensure alignment
